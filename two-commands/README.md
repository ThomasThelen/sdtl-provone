# Single Command Example

This is an example of an SPSS program that creates two variables that are independent of each other.

### Prov Model Notes
The main difference between this example and the single command example is that the main `provone:Program` has two `provone:Program`s direclty underneath it, connected via `provone:hasSubProgram`.



### SDTL Embedding Notes
There isn't much to say about how the SDTL is embedded in ProvONE since its similar to the single command example. In this case, the SDTL from the second command is embedded in the respective ProvONE objects.
